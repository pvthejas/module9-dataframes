# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in each game this
# season (google "Seahawks" for the info!)
Seahawks <- c(20, 31, 31, 15, 5, 40, 10, 24, 31, 25, 26, 20)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each game this season
vs.Seahawks <- c(25, 25, 24, 26, 14, 7, 38, 3, 34, 23, 6, 36)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
score <- data.frame(Seahawks, vs.Seahawks)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points.
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
score$diff <- score[[1]] - score[[2]]

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won
score$won <- score[[1]] > score[[2]]

# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents


# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
